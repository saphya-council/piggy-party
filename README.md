Description:
Students will learn the basics of 3D modeling, animation, lighting, materials and shaders, as well as the asset pipeline for Blender in the first 7 weeks. Students will apply these skills to create a 3D animation project for the midterm. The second half of the class focuses on scripting and game development using Unity. Students will produce an interactive 3D game for their final projects. Class time will be split between discussions of video games and related media (including game history, mainstream and indie games, art games, and other interactive projects), presentation and critique of student work, as well as demonstrations using Blender and Unity."
